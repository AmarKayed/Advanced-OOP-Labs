Singleton == Design Pattern


Singleton is used when we want to create a class that contains a single object
of its type.

The Java Spring Framework uses a lot of classes that are by default Singleton



Singleton Steps:

    1. The Singleton class must have a private constructor
    2. In the Singleton class we will have a static attribute that contains an instance of that class
    3. In the Singleton class we will have a static method that returns the instance of the class

To create an abstract class we use the "abstract" access modifier:
    public abstract class AbstractClass{

    }

To create an abstract class method we use "abstract" along with ;
    public abstract String getName();

String-ul in Java este immutable
