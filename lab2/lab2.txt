In Java we can extend only one class at a time.

IntelliJ Code With Me:
    Near the Execute Button we have a person silhouette symbol.
    Click on that > Join Another IDE as Participant > Paste Shared Link

In Java we have a default constructor that contains no argument.

Variables have a default value as followind:
    int, float, double will be initialized with 0
    String will be initialized with null
    boolean will be initialized with false

Creating Enum:
    Right Click on the package > New > Java Class > Enum

Generate Automatic Getters and Setters:
    Right Click on the Code > Generate > Getters and Setters
    and then select the attributes for which you want to generate
    the getters and setters.

    Or:
        Alt + Insert

To rename all appearances of a variable we use:
    Click on the variable name > Shift + F6

    Or:
        Right Click Class > Refractor > Rename


Exercise:
    Bird bird1 = new Bird(1, "Lisa");
    Bird bird2 = new Bird(1, "Lisa");
    Bird bird3 = bird1;

    System.out.println(bird1 == bird2);
    // This will output false, because bird1 == bird2 compares the references.
    System.out.println(bird1 == bird3);
    // This will output true, because it is the same reference.


Change the behaviour of ==:
    Right Click > Generate > Override Methods > equals()

    In Java we cannot override operators, but
    we know that == uses the Object.equals()
    method, thus we can instead override the equals()
    method.
